We kept the default runners to start the system. 

Simply run Main.Server to start the server, the runner takes an integer port number as a parameter, currently set to 4444.

Run the client from Main.Client, it will automatically open the GUI and guide you through inputting the IP address and port of the server, connecting and picking a username, etc. 

For more information on what each window/button/text field does/means see the "GUI and FrontEnd Design & Features" section in our Project Report PDF (located in the docs folder).
